## DESIGN

### COLORS

The main color scheme is simple, all page elements being based on a green color and white background. This is mainly to limit distractions, but also the green represent the true color of Ireland. The images over the blog will have all different shades of green and this will complement the dark green/white combo.

### TYPOGRAPY

### WIREFRAMES

<details><summary>Wireframes created with the help of Figma</summary>
<img src="assets/readme/landing.png">
<img src="assets/readme/categories.png">
<img src="assets/readme/post.png">

- Even though the final design is slightly different to the wireframes as they were created before starting the porject, it has been very helpful to have them along the development process.

### DATABASE DESIGN

- Due to unforseen events the time to work on the project has been reduced hance the database diagram is updated to the current achievements. Hopefully all models will be implemented in the future.
</details>

## AGILE 

- GitHub issues and Github Projects were used to plans and manage the development process. Different attempts have been used as the initial approach didn't feel the easiest way. 
- All Users stories and some EPICs were converted into issues and split into sprints. Some issues have been moved around over the course of development as the work load involved wasn't realistically considered. 
- User stories have also been labeled according to the MoSCoW method.
- As issues were handled they have been moved from the  **Todo this Iteration**, to **In Progress**, to **Done**. If an issue couldn't be approached it was moved back to the **Global Backlog** for reconsideration, then into **Won't Have** if couldn't be implemented.
